In UCSC EdgeLab, we study and build distributed data management
systems. We are interested in systems that span large geographic
areas and infrastructures, including cloud and edge environments.


## UCSC goal: WedgeDB

Wide-area Edge DB (WedgeDB) is a distributed database that span cloud
and edge nodes.  WedgeDB distributes storage and compute resources
close to users to enable fast access. In EdgeLab, we tackle various
research problems to realize WedgeDB. These research problems span
topics such as consensus, byzantine agreement, transaction
processing, and data indexing.
